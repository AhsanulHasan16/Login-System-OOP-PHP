# Login-System-OOP-PHP
Just a simple login and signup system using the Object Oriented Programming structure of PHP. 
The page only consists of some basic HTML as of now. I will be adding some CSS code in the project to make the page more beautiful. Will do that in hopefully the coming days. 

# Database 
All the data from the signup will go to the MySQL database. As server, used XAMPP localhost. 

# Description
The includes folder contains all the documents for the view part. Those were the part which will be used to display the results to the user. The classes folder will contain the model and the controller classes needed for the system. Both login and signup has their model, view and controller classes. 
Take a look at the codes to see which classes used and extended which ones. 

# Connection Configuration 
The dbconfig file contains all the codes that were used to configure the connections to the database. In this project, I used the PDO method to connect to the database. 

This was not some very big project or anything. I just worked on and created one small part of a big project just to learn and understand the OOP(Object Oriented Programming) way of PHP well. 
I do have a plan to build a full big project using OOP PHP in the near future.
